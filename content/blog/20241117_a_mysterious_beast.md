Mathematics is well appreciated when you find an application, or you will find its beauty when you get a chance to apply it. However, it depends on your life dynamics. In my life, I enjoyed doing math until a strange incident. But let's talk about Author Edward Frenkel; let's call him Ed. Yeah, it's the same with him, but it's a different scenario. He found it to be boring. He finds books on quantum physics attractive. Let's keep this idea straightforward. In general, humans used to think matter is made of fundamental particles called atoms. As far as I know, nothing in science ended with "We found everything about this field". New evidence shows that atoms are made of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Later, the author read a book that states that all the particles are themselves made of quarks. I kinda like the name "Quark". It's the same with the author. He points the origin of its name to a mock poem by James Joyce's Finnegans Wake.

Like most of us, the author enjoys trying out many aspects of life other than science. Just like the physicist who named the quark straight from a novel. So here is the crucial aspect of the author's life. This book by Gell Mann states that protons are made of two up quarks and one down quark; neutrons are made of one up and two down quarks. But the main question here is how they know that, of course, science doesn't care about assumptions without proof.

This is how this story goes: By late 1950, scientists discovered protons and neutrons were made of apparently fundamental particles called hadrons. Gell Mann and Yuval independently proposed showed that it could be naturally divided into 8 to 10 classes called octets and decoplets. But why precisely 8 or 10? The book the author was reading didn't provide any explanation as to why they did that.

This has been a mystery for our author. However, he was lucky enough to get help from his family friend. In short, there was a mathematician named Evgeny, an old friend of his parents. Once he met Ed's mother and went through their discussion, Evgeny learned that Ed hates math and that he was interested in converting Ed to math. So Evgeny and Ed's mother together decided for a meeting with Ed.

However, Ed was not very keen on this meeting. He met Evgeny in his office. Evgeny knows Ed was interested in quantum physics from his mother. This is how the conversation starts.

Ev (Evgeny): I heard you like quantum physics. Have you heard about Gell-Mann's eight-fold theory and the quantum model?

Ed: yes, I have read about this in several popular books

Ev: But do you know what the basis of this model is? How did he come up with these ideas?

Ed: Well.., Have you heard of this group SU(3)?

Ev: SU what?

Ed: How can you possibly understand the quark model if you don't know what the group SU (3) is?

Now, Evgeny pulls a few books out and shows Ed some pages of formulas, and Ed sees a similar picture that is used to describe the eight-fold theory better; now, he realizes that these books contain detailed explanations for the question he's searching for. And this is the movement of epiphany.

Here are the exact words from the book

**I was mesmerized by what I was seeing and hearing: touched by something I had never experienced before, unable to express in words but feeling the energy, the excitement one feels when hearing a piece of music or seeing a painting that makes an unforgettable impression. All I could think was, "Wow!"**

Evgeny: you probably thought that Mathematics is what is taught in the school... 

"No, this", he pointed at the formulas in the book - "is what mathematics is about. And if you really want to understand quantum physics, this is where you need to start: gell-man predicted quarks using a beautiful mathematical theory; it was, in fact, a mathematical discovery."

Ed: but how do I begin to understand this stuff? 

Evgeny: No worries. The first thing you need to learn is the symmetry group. That's the main idea. A large part of mathematics and theoretical physics are based on it; here are some books I want to give to you. Start reading them and mark sentences that you don't understand. We can meet here every week and talk about this.

Evgeny gave a few books on symmetry groups and some other different topics, especially p-adic numbers and topology. 

Ed points out Evgeny had impeccable taste: he found a perfect combination of topics that would allow me to see this mysterious beast - *Mathematics* from different sides and get excited about it.

We all look at mathematics from different perspectives. All we see is what we were taught in school. Everything that feels interesting to us may only be interesting to some people, depending on how we perceive the ideas. Thankfully, we had the language to help others understand these ideas. Finally, Ed mentions that "the books Evgeny gave contained glimpses of an entirely different world whose existence I couldn't imagine. I was instantly converted."
