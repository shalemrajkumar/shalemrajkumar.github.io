Currently, I am a Research Assistant in the [Laboratory of Neural Systems] at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK). Please have a look at the [research page] for more information about my current work.

**Academic**: Before my current RA position, I completed a BT-MT Dual in Biological Sciences and BioEngineering at IITK. My Master's thesis focuses on the Computational Neuroscience of the Fly Olfactory System, specifically computational modeling of odor discrimination and valence assignment in the *Drosophila melanogaster* under the supervision of [Dr. Nitin Gupta].
